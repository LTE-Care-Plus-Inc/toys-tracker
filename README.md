# 🎁 Toys Budget Dashboard

A Streamlit-based internal dashboard for tracking client toy/material budgets under a 6-month reset policy.

This system ensures accurate enforcement of the business rule:

> Each client receives **$25 every 6 months**.  
> If the full $25 is used, the client must wait 6 months from their last purchase before receiving another $25.

---

## 🏢 Business Purpose

This dashboard provides LTE staff with:

- Clear visibility into each client’s current budget cycle
- Real-time tracking of purchased vs pending amounts
- Automatic 6-month reset enforcement
- Prevention of over-budget purchases
- Simple filtering by action status

It eliminates spreadsheet confusion and manual calculations.

## 🔁 Budget Policy Logic (Reset Model)

Each client operates under a **reset model**, not a rolling sum model.

### Rules:

1. Only rows where `Purchased = TRUE` count against the budget.
2. The 6-month reset clock starts from the **most recent purchase date**.
3. If 6 months pass, the client’s budget resets to $25.
4. Pending requests do NOT reduce balance until purchased.
5. Budget does not roll over.

## 🧠 Action Status Definitions

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Eligible** | No purchases in current cycle. Full $25 available. |
| **Purchased** | Partial spend within current 6-month cycle. |
| **Place Order** | Pending request exists and fits within remaining balance. |
| **Over Budget — Pending** | Pending request exceeds remaining balance. |
| **Not Eligible — Wait 6 Months** | Full $25 used and reset window not reached. |

## 📊 KPI Cards

The dashboard displays:

- **Total Purchased** – Total dollars officially spent
- **Total Pending** – Total requested but not yet purchased
- **Clients Not Eligible** – Clients who must wait for reset
